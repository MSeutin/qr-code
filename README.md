# Vanilla JS Web App
This program makes use of a public API to create QR Codes

## Step 1
- Create your html structure
- I recommend a header, and a container below the header
- the container should have two div cards (can be done differently)

## Step 2
- Link your css and js files from within your index.html
- In your html make sure your css and js files work

## Step 3
- Setup your firs card (Generate QR Code) to have an input and fieldset (look at html docs for fieldset)
- Fieldset will allow you to pick from different choices
- grab some free qr code png with the appropriate colors to pair with your input of type radio

## Step 4
- make sure in your js files that you can access your input and fieldset

## Step 5
- Look at the API docs provided on website and continue.
